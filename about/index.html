            <p>Our mission is to empower ambitious students to do what fulfils them, and do it with success. It is no coincidence that Design Thinking has propelled Silicon Valley to become the world’s most innovative place. We started Immersion to share
                those ways of thinking with the rest of the world.
            </p>
            <p>We value ways of thinking over rote knowledge, and believe that effective leadership comes from creative confidence and the ability to grapple with complexity. At Immersion, our mission is to arm out students with the necessary tools to move
                fast, bring their visions into reality, and make decisions that benefit the world. Along the world, they might just change it.
